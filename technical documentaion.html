                <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language
                    used to create webpages. It provides the basic structure of
                    a website, which is enhanced and modified by other
                    technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML consists of a
                    series of elements, represented by tags, that define the
                    content and layout of a webpage. For example, headings,
                    paragraphs, images, and links are all created using specific
                    HTML tags . These elements are
                    placed inside an HTML document, which starts
                    with the declaration and is
                    wrapped within tags. HTML is the
                    foundation of web development and is
                    essential for building static or dynamic
                    webpages.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt id="css">CSS BASICS</dt>
                <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used
                    to describe the presentation of a webpage, including layout,
                    colors, fonts, and spacing. It allows developers to separate
                    content (HTML) from design, making it easier to maintain and
                    style websites. CSS rules consist of selectors (like p for
                    paragraphs or .class-name for classes) and declarations that
                    define the styles to apply. For example, you can change the
                    text color of a paragraph to blue using the rule p { color:
                    blue; }. CSS can be applied in three ways: inline (within an
                    HTML element), internal (within a
                    style tag in the HTML document), or external (linked via a
                    separate .css file).
                    By using CSS, developers can create visually appealing and
                    consistent designs across their websites.</dd>

                <dt id="js">JAVASCRIPT BASICS</dt>
                <dd>JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight programming language
                    used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to
                    webpages. While HTML structures content and CSS styles it,
                    JavaScript makes the webpage come alive by handling tasks
                    like responding to user actions, updating content
                    dynamically, and interacting with web APIs. JavaScript code
                    can be written directly inside an HTML file within
                    tags or included as an external .js file. Core concepts
                    include variables (e.g., let x = 5;), functions (e.g.,
                    function greet() { alert('Hello!'); }), and event handling
                    (e.g., clicking a button to trigger an action). JavaScript
                    is an essential tool for web development and forms the
                    backbone of modern web applications, enabling features like
                    animations, form validation, and real-time updates.</dd>

                    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript
                    runtime environment that executes JavaScript code
                    outside of a web browser. It allows developers to run
                    JavaScript on the server-side, enabling them to build
                    scalable, real-time web applications with ease. Node.js
                    uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes
                    it lightweight and efficient, ideal for data-intensive
